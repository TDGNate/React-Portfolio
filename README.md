# Nate's React Portfolio

This is my main portfolio that I will be presenting which showcases my projects, experience, and skills.

My portfolio has an about me, projects, skills, and a contact section modularized into componets. And if the viewer chooses to dedicate their atention to just my projects, I created a whole page displaying every single one of my projects and the tools I used to create it.

This website is powered my React.js, and is deployed on Github pages.
